## Fallback URL is required

The initiate payment must contain a `fallBack` URL. This is where the user will be redirect to after the payment.
This is set in the initiate payment body.

For apps, this URL will be the appswitch URL.

If you do not have a fallback (or "result" page), you can use the main URL for your company:
`https://example.com/fallback-dummy`, or similar. Please use a URL that returns `HTTP 200 OK`.

The URL must be valid.
See [here](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/vipps-ecom-api.md#url-validation) for details.

## Migration

If you have already signed an agreement with Vipps, and have API keys for eCom v1, you can use the same API keys
for eCom v2.

## Subscription keys

When you have received confirmation that your new sales unit is created, then you can retrieve the API keys on https://portal.vipps.no. See [Getting started](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-getting-started.md).

## New endpoint

The eCom v2 API is available at `ecomm/v2/payments`:

- Test: `https://apitest.vipps.no/ecomm/v2/payments`
- Prod: `https://api.vipps.no/ecomm/v2/payments`

## Documentation

The eCom v2 API documentation is available here: https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api
